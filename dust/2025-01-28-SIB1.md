$\bbR$

For simplicity, throughout this discussion we work only with finite-dimensional real vector spaces. In this setting, a **tensor** is simply an element of a tensor product of such spaces. A vector is a rank-one tensor $\vv \in \bbR^d$,  a matrix is a rank-two tensor $\mA \in \bbR^d \otimes \bbR^d$, and in general a rank-$n$ tensor is an element of

$$
\tT \in \bbR^{d^{\otimes n}}.
$$

Fix the standard basis $\{\ve_i\}_{i=1}^d$ of $\bbR^d$.  
Any tensor $\tT \in \bbR^{d^{\otimes n}}$ admits a unique expansion over this basis,

$$
\tT
  = \sum_{i_1=1}^d \cdots \sum_{i_n=1}^d
      \tT(i_1,\dots,i_n)\,
      \ve_{i_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\ve_{i_n},
$$

so the tensor is described by its $d^n$ coefficients  
$\tT(i_1,\dots,i_n)$, often written compactly as $\tT(\vi)$.

These coefficients can be viewed as indexing an $n$-dimensional array,  
but the tensor itself is not intrinsically an array;  
it is an element of a multilinear algebraic construction.  
The array representation arises only after a choice of basis,  
and different choices produce different coordinate descriptions of the same underlying tensor.
