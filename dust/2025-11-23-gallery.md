excerpt: "A curated gallery of plots and visualizations from my research and projects."
---

Welcome to the Gallery post. Here, you'll find a curated collection of plots and visualizations from my past research papers, experiments, and side projects.

This gallery is a mix of formal and informal work. I use this space to document the ideas that I found visually or mathematically compelling, even if they never made it into a final publication.

<!-- If you want to include individual gallery entries from the `_gallery/` collection,
     you can add them here or link to them. Example: -->

{% raw %}{% for item in site.gallery | sort: 'title' %}
### {{ item.title }}

{{ item.content | markdownify }}

{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
