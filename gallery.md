  Welcome to the Gallery page. Here, you'll find a curated collection of plots and visualizations from my past research papers, experiments, and side projects.

  This gallery is a mix of formal and informal work. I use this space to document the ideas that I found visually or mathematically compelling, even if they never made it into a final publication.
