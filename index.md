title: About Me

---
Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in the [Applied and Computational Mathematics department](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad/grad_acm) at Caltech, advised by Professor Joel Tropp. My research focuses on the intersection of randomized numerical linear algebra (rNLA) and large-scale data science, with an emphasis on scalable algorithms and high-dimensional computation. 

I am currently funded through the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org) and the      [Kortschak Scholars Fellowship](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/kortschak-scholars).

## Research Interests

- **Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra**: matrix sketching, fast linear solvers, randomized eigensolvers, algorithm acceleration.
- **Tensor Networks and Quantum Mechanical Simulation**: MPO-MPS contraction, randomized methods for tensor networks, efficient Hamiltonian time evolution.
- **Approximate Gaussian Processes**: sub-cubic gaussian process models, inducing point approximations, conjugate gradient methods for kernel inversion.
<!-- - **Bayesian Inference**: Approximate Gaussian processes, structured priors and uncertainty quantification in modern machine learning models. -->
