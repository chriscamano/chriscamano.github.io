I’m a second-year PhD student in the [Applied and Computational Mathematics department](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad/grad_acm) at Caltech, advised by Professor [Joel Tropp](https://tropp.caltech.edu). My research focuses on the intersection of randomized numerical linear algebra (rNLA) and large-scale data science, with an emphasis on *random tensors*.

I am currently funded through the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org), and the [Kortschak Scholars Fellowship](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/kortschak-scholars).

## Research Interests

- <span style="font-size:1.05em; font-weight:bold;">Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra</span>: matrix sketching, fast linear solvers, randomized eigensolvers, algorithm acceleration.
- <span style="font-size:1.05em; font-weight:bold;">Tensor Networks and Quantum Mechanical Simulation</span>: MPO-MPS contraction, randomized methods for tensor networks, efficient Hamiltonian time evolution.
- <span style="font-size:1.05em; font-weight:bold;">Approximate Gaussian Processes</span>: sub-cubic gaussian process models, inducing point approximations, conjugate gradient methods for kernel inversion.
<!-- - **Bayesian Inference**: Approximate Gaussian processes, structured priors and uncertainty quantification in modern machine learning models. -->
